# 📅 Day 3 – NumPy Practice (AI Engineer Journey)

## 🚀 Overview
Today I practiced important NumPy concepts as part of my AI Engineering journey.

This is Day 3 of building strong fundamentals in Python for AI.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Power
- Modulus

Performed operations on 1D and 2D arrays.

---

### 2️⃣ Arithmetic Functions
Used NumPy built-in mathematical functions:

- `np.min()`
- `np.max()`
- `np.argmin()`
- `np.argmax()`
- `np.sqrt()`
- `np.sin()`
- `np.cos()`
- `np.cumsum()`

Learned how:
- To find minimum & maximum values
- To find positions using `argmin()` and `argmax()`
- To perform element-wise mathematical operations
- To use `axis` in 2D arrays

---

### 3️⃣ Shape in NumPy
- Learned how to check array shape
- Understood dimensions in 1D and 2D arrays
- Practiced reshaping arrays

---

## 🧠 Key Learning

- NumPy performs element-wise operations efficiently.
- `axis=0` works column-wise.
- `axis=1` works row-wise.
- Mathematical functions in NumPy are optimized and faster than normal Python loops.

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters for AI

NumPy is the foundation of:
- Data manipulation
- Matrix operations
- Linear algebra
- Machine learning algorithms

Strong NumPy = Strong AI foundation.
